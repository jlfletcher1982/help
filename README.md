Summary
With the recent success of on-demand rideshare services, such as Uber and Lyft, we wish to capitalize on their success and ideology by 
providing an on-demand service for other day-to-day tasks.  This would be done by connecting users through a mobile application where
they can find post jobs or tasks they wish to be completed, or allowing users to find listings of tasks they wish to complete. 
For instance, user A would like someone to mow their yard.  User A can post a request for this task on the application, along with a 
payment offer (say $20).  User B, in need of some quick cash, can scroll through job requests, finding one that he wants to perform. 
User B posts on User A’s request for having his lawn mowed, and both users agree on a time and compensation. The type of tasks available for posting won’t be limited by us, but only categorized into multiple different types of tasks.  Possibilities include lawn maintenance, home moving help, or just needing a handyman to fix a few things around the house (home maintenance).
